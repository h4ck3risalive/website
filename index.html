        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a seasoned Cloud Solutions Architect and Database Administrator with over 12 years of experience in the IT industry. My expertise spans database technologies (Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, SQL Server), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI), and DevOps practices. I specialize in architecting highly available, secure, and scalable systems, migrating workloads to the cloud, and optimizing performance and costs.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I've led migrations from on-premises to cloud environments, implemented CI/CD pipelines for databases, and ensured compliance with security standards. I'm passionate about leveraging cloud-native technologies to drive innovation and efficiency.</p>
